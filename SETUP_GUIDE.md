### 1. Product Configuration

#### Setting Up a Beat Product

1. **Create a Variable Product** in WooCommerce:
   - Go to Products ‚Üí Add New
   - Product Type: **Variable Product**
   - Add product name (e.g., "Dark Trap Beat")

2. **Add Product Meta Fields** (for filters):
   You need to add custom meta fields to your products. Use a plugin like "Advanced Custom Fields" or add them directly via code.
   
   Required custom fields:
   - `genre` - e.g., "Hip Hop", "Trap", "R&B", "Pop"
   - `bpm` - e.g., "140", "85", "120"
   - `mood` - e.g., "Dark", "Uplifting", "Chill", "Aggressive"
   - `key` - e.g., "Am", "C", "Dm", "F#"
   - `audio_url` - **IMPORTANT**: Full URL to the audio preview file

3. **Audio File Storage**:
   
   **Recommended Options:**
   
   a. **AWS S3** (Recommended for scalability):
      - Upload your beat previews to S3
      - Make them publicly accessible or use signed URLs
      - Copy the full URL (e.g., `https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/beats/beat-name.mp3`)
      - Add this URL to the `audio_url` custom field
   
   b. **WordPress Media Library**:
      - Upload audio file to Media Library
      - Copy the file URL
      - Add to `audio_url` custom field
   
   c. **External CDN** (Cloudflare R2, etc.):
      - Upload to your CDN
      - Get the public URL
      - Add to `audio_url` custom field

4. **Create License Variations**:
   - Go to Product Data ‚Üí Variations
   - Create variations for different license types
   - Example variations:
     * **Basic License** - ¬£29.99
       - Attributes: License Type: Basic
     * **Premium License** - ¬£79.99
       - Attributes: License Type: Premium
     * **Exclusive Rights** - ¬£299.99
       - Attributes: License Type: Exclusive

5. **Publish the Product**:
   - Click "Publish" to make it available in the store

### 2. Example Product Structure

```json
{
  "name": "Dark Trap Beat",
  "type": "variable",
  "status": "publish",
  "meta_data": [
    {"key": "genre", "value": "Trap"},
    {"key": "bpm", "value": "140"},
    {"key": "mood", "value": "Dark"},
    {"key": "key", "value": "Am"},
